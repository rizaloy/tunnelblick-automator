# Custom Tunnelblick Automator for Mac
An automator for Tunnelblick to turning off wifi, route flush and turn on the wifi again

1. Copy the `connect-to-vpn` folder to your `/Users/your-username/` folder
2. Copy the `connect.app` automator to your Application folder or Desktop, run the automator by double clicking on it

Cheers,
